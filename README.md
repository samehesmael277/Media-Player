## Overview

Media Player is an Android app built with Kotlin, developed as a task during my internship at InternSavy. It's a feature-rich audio player application designed to fetch audio media from your phone and provide an immersive playback experience. This app includes playback controls with play/pause, next, and previous buttons, displays music duration, current position, and includes a seekbar for manual position control. It leverages Coroutines and Lifecycle components for smooth operation, utilizes Coil library for efficient image loading, and incorporates ViewBinding and Intuit library for responsive XML layouts with `sdp` and `ssp` units.
